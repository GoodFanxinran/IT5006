Areas within digital libraries that will be covered include collection development, knowledge organisation, DL architecture, user behavior, services, preservation, management and evaluation and DL education and research. Students will round out their knowledge with case studies of how different disciplines (e.g. music, arts, medicine and law) impose different search, usability and maintenance requirements on the digital library."

CS6243	Computational Photography	4	 3-0-0-4-3	"This course covers the exciting new area of “Computational photography”, which refers to a broad group of imaging and processing techniques that enhances or extends the capabilities of digital photography to produce new photographs that could not have been taken by a traditional camera. Computational photography promises to change the way we think about photography."	
CS6244	Robot Motion Planning & Control	4	 2-0-0-5-3	"An array of new robots with amazing capabilities appeared in the last decade, e.g., self-driving cars, humanoids, and robot vacuum cleaners. They will gradually, but surely, transform our ways of life in the near future. This course presents the key algorithmic ideas and implementation techniques that enable autonomous robot planning and control. It covers the geometric, probabilistic, and dynamic models and the associated methods commonly used in robotics. Application to related fields, such as computer animation and computation biology, will also be discussed."	AI
CS6270	Virtual Machines	4	 2-0-0-2-6	"Virtual machines (VMs) are increasingly being seen as a convenient vehicle for managing heterogeneous resources (e.g. server consolidation) and for solving problems related to mobile code and security. Commercial VMs from VMware and language-level VMs such as the Java Virtual Machine and Microsoft’s .NET framework have become highly popular. This module will summarise the state-of-the-art in virtualisation technology and discuss techniques for designing and implementing modern VMs, hardware-level, operating system-level and language-level VMs, CPU virtualisation concepts, paravirtualisation and binary translation techniques, techniques for memory and input/output virtualisation, and applications of VMs in solving problems related to security and software distribution."	
CS6280	Datacentre Software Dynamics	4	 2-0-0-4-4	"Datacenter computing favors response time over throughput. Controlling slow response times results in more efficient server use, which is worth literally millions of dollars within the datacenter industry.  This module focuses on understanding and controlling the sources of latency in a datacentre, especially the long-tail delays that ruin a user experience.  The module offers a hands on component where students will perform measurement studies on the latency of various software and hardware subsystems, and investigate the unexpected ways that these layers interact."
